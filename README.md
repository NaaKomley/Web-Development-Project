Project Description
The purpose of this project was to learn and practice basic web development concepts and understand the building blocks that make some of our favourite websites and web applications like YouTube and Netflix. 
Through this project, I practiced core concepts such as HTML structure, CSS styling, layouts, responsiveness and basic interactivity.
One of the main challenges I faced was replicating layouts accurately, especially aligning elements properly and making the pages responsive across different screen sizes. Another challenge was resisting the urge to overcomplicate things and instead focusing on mastering the basics, since this project is meant as a learning exercise rather than a pixel-perfect copy
